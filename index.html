<h2>About</h2>

<p> I'm currently working on a report about anti-tamper self-destruct mechanisms for GPUs as part of the ERA AI Fellowship. See below if you want to email me for an early draft, or if you know something on the topic. </p>

<p> I'm also finishing up a working on a whitepaper with Robert Trager and Morgan Simpson about voluntary safety in nuclear power and aviation. I did some contract research on the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Open Philanthropy, which you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYpHPqMz37Ba6C_XVajoxOzMKoDN9bYFQGt2Ygf7FwI/edit#heading=h.7ew9ld9e679u">here.</a> </p>

<p> Previously, I ran EA Oxford for a year, and did an MSci Physics and Philosophy at Bristol </p>
