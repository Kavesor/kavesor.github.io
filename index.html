<h2>About</h2>
<p> I recently started doing AI governance research. My main experience is in extracting lessons for AI from nuclear power safety. </p>

<p> I'm currently working on a whitepaper with Robert Trager and Morgan Simpson about voluntary safety in nuclear power and aviation. Previously did some contract research on the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for Open Philanthropy. You can see the report <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYpHPqMz37Ba6C_XVajoxOzMKoDN9bYFQGt2Ygf7FwI/edit#heading=h.7ew9ld9e679u">here.</a> </p>

<p> If you're reading this, I'm probably interested in hearing from you. You can contact me at [alexor487][at][gmail][dot][com] </p>
<p> I'm looking for the next project to work on, so if you're hiring for short-term work, or looking for a collaborator on something related, please do get in contact </p>

<p> You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alej__oop"> Twitter</a> and  <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ortegaalejandro/">Letterboxd </a>, Goodrea and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/kavesor/playlists">Spotify</a> and aspirationally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39681526-alejandro-ortega">Goodreads</a>   </p>



<p> Notes to self: check custom domain https,configure www custom domain, in footer link to Notion notes and reads, use Jekyll to make it pretty; "Alejandro across the internet"; "media"; "things I've done previously e.g. UC/quizzing, things I'm interested in", research questions I'm interested in at the moment (keep this as a doc that I can keep updating I guess)  </p>
