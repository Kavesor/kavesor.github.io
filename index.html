<h2>About</h2>
<p> I'm an AI governance researcher. My main experience is in extracting lessons for AI from studying nuclear power safety. 

I'm currently working on a whitepaper with Robert Trager and Morgan Simpson about voluntary safety and cooperation in nuclear power and aviation.

Previously I did contract research for Open Philanthropy about the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYpHPqMz37Ba6C_XVajoxOzMKoDN9bYFQGt2Ygf7FwI/edit#heading=h.7ew9ld9e679u">here</a> </p>
