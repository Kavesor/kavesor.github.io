<h2>About</h2>
<p> I recently started doing AI governance research. My main experience is in extracting lessons for AI from nuclear power safety. </p>

<p> I'm currently working on a whitepaper with Robert Trager and Morgan Simpson about voluntary safety in nuclear power and aviation. Previously I looked into the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYpHPqMz37Ba6C_XVajoxOzMKoDN9bYFQGt2Ygf7FwI/edit#heading=h.7ew9ld9e679u">here</a> </p>

<p> If you're reading this, I'm probably interested in hearing from you. You can contact me at [alexor487][at][gmail][dot][com] </p>
